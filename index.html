							<aside class="notes">
								Imputation is a method of correcting errors
								and estimating and filling in missing values in a data set.
								Where there are errors in the data set, and when these are
								considered to add no value in the correction process, these
								values are set to missing and are imputed with a plausible
								estimate. Alternatively, missing values may already exist in
								the data, and imputation may be carried out to produce a
								complete data set for analysis

								Methods of variable treatment can be grouped into one of the following categories:
								<br> interactive treatment
								<br> Deductive imputation uses logic or an understanding about
								the relationship between variables and units to fill in
								missing values. Examples include deriving a value as a
								function of other values, adopting a value from a related unit,
								and adopting a value from an earlier time point. Generally,
								this method is used when the true value can be derived with
								certainty or with a very high probability.
								<br> model based imputation
								<br> donor based imputation
								<br> Donor based imputation adopt values from an observed unit,
								which are then used for the missing unit. For each recipient
								with a missing value for variable y, a donor is identified
								that is similar to the recipient with respect to certain
								background characteristics (often referred to as matching
								variables) that are related to the target variable y.
								These methods are ideal when there are
								several related missing values in one record, and if the
								intention is to preserve the relationship between variables.

								CANCEIS is a tool that is used to carry out editing and

							</p>
							<aside class="notes">
								At a high level, you can break the CANCEIS process into:
								<br> input
								<br> process
								<br> output
								<br> At the input stage, you specify the edit rules, which tell
								CANCEIS how to spot invalid or implausible responses for a
								given variable or how to spot an incorrect or implausible combination of responses
								across multiple variables.
								<br> At the input stage, you also instruct CANCIES on how to find
								donors. Remember that with donor imputation, we are trying to impute
								values using respondents that we think would have responded similarly.
								So we give CANCEIS instructions on how to find this "similar" unit.
								<br> At the process stage:
								<br> 1) units get sorted based on a set of edit rules, where
								they either pass and become donors or fail and become recipients
								<br> 2) imputation is carried out. this can be done deductively
								using the edit rules. Or donors and recipients are matched on qualitative and
								quantitative variables, to identify nearest neighbours
								<br> 3) imputed responses are evaluated against the edit rules.
								If they pass these edit rules, they are retained. If they fail,
								we repeat the search for a donor.
								<br> At the output stage, you get your edited and imputed dataset,
								as well as a bunch of metadata, which describes the output. And
								you also get a bunch of paradata, which describes the process.

							<aside class="notes">
								If we are to look at the CANCEIS methodology through the
								GSDEM lense, it would take the following form:
								<br> CANCIES uses the data dictionary and decision logic table
								to review the variables you've asked it to edit and impute; to
								identify potentially problematic values
								<br> Using your parameters in the data dictionary and decision
								logic table, it selects units for treatment
								<br> During the treatment phase, it will transform your dataset
								using deductive and donor imputation. For the latter, it can use
								either a deterministic or stochastic mechanism. That is, when it
								is selecting a donor it can either randomly select a donor or
								select the "best" possible donor.
								<br> The type of donor imputation it carries out is called minimum
								change nearest neighbour imputation. What this means is that when
								it is looking for a donor; it looks both at whether the imputed
								value would pass the edit rules and how far this new value is
								from the original value. For example if a unit's net
								income is reported as being greater than their gross income,
								this unit will be selected for treatment. During the donor search
								process, it will look for imputed values for both gross and net
								income. And then select an imputation action that would preserve
								the net-gross relationship but also result in smallest change to
								reported values.
